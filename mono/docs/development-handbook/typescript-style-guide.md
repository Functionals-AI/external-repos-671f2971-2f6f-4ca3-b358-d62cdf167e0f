# TypeScript Style Guide

Microsoft's group developing TypeScript has a set of [Coding Guidlines](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines). They are not necessarily recommendations to those using TypeScript in general, but can be adopted. It is recommended to turn there where aspects of coding style are not spelled out in this document.
