# Notes on Dependencies

## Date / Time
[Luxon](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/) should be used for date / time operations. Although there are probably advantages over other packages, the following are some advantages:

  * Very intuitive support for working with date / time with timezones ([Time zones and offsets](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/zones)].
  * Intuitive support for [Formatting](https://moment.github.io/luxon/#/formatting), including ISO8601.
