<p><strong>Foodsmart Nutrition Network Informed Consent for Telehealth Services</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telehealth involves the use of electronic communications to enable healthcare providers at different locations to share individual patient medical information for the purpose of improving patient care. Telehealth services offered by </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Foodsmart Nutrition Network (&ldquo;FNN&rdquo;; operating under the legal provider groups of Zipongo Health Provider Group, P.A. DBA Foodsmart Nutrition Network; Foodsmart Nutrition Network of New Jersey, P.C.; Foodsmart Nutrition Network of Kansas, P.A.; and David Ashley, MD, P.C. DBA Foodsmart Nutrition Network) </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">may also include chart review, remote prescribing, appointment scheduling, health information sharing, and non- clinical services, such as patient education. The information you provide may be used for diagnosis, therapy, follow-up and/or patient education, and may include any combination of the following: (1) health records and test results; (2) images and asynchronous communications; (3) live two-way audio and video; (4) interactive audio with store and forward; and (5) output data from medical devices and sound and video files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The electronic communication systems we use will incorporate network and software security protocols to protect the confidentiality of patient identification and imaging data and will include measures to safeguard the data and to ensure its integrity against intentional or unintentional corruption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FNN providers (our &ldquo;providers&rdquo;) are an addition to, and not a replacement for, your primary care physician. Responsibility for your overall medical care should remain with your local primary care doctor, if you have one, and we strongly encourage you to locate one if you do not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Expected Benefits:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved access to care by enabling you to remain in your home while the FNN provider consults and obtains test results at distant/other sites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">More efficient care evaluation and management.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obtaining expertise of a specialist as appropriate.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Possible Risks:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Delays in evaluation and treatment could occur due to deficiencies or failures of the equipment and technologies.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rare events, our provider may determine that the transmitted information is of inadequate quality, thus necessitating a rescheduled telehealth consult or a meeting with your local primary care doctor.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In very rare events, security protocols could fail, causing a breach of privacy of personal medical information.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In rare events, a lack of access to complete medical records may result in adverse drug interactions or allergic reactions or other judgment errors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you need to receive follow-up care, assistance in the event of an adverse reaction to the treatment, or in the event of an inability to communicate as a result of a technological or equipment failure, please contact FNN at 888- 837-5325 or email: </span><a href="mailto:telenutrition@zipongo.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">telenutrition@foodsmart.com.</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Y</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">ou acknowledge that you understand and agree with the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I hereby consent to receiving FNN&rsquo;s services via telehealth technologies. I understand that FNN and its providers offer telehealth-based medical services, but that these services do not replace the relationship between me and my primary care doctor. I also understand it is up to the FNN provider to determine whether or not my specific clinical needs are appropriate for a telehealth encounter.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have the right to contact FNN prior to my scheduled consult to select an alternative provider, or to review my provider&rsquo;s credentials.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I authorize my provider&rsquo;s office to contact me by mobile phone.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that federal and state law requires health care providers to protect the privacy and the security of health information. I understand that FNN will take steps to make sure that my health information is not seen by anyone who should not see it. I understand that telehealth may involve electronic communication of my personal medical information to other health practitioners who may be located in other areas, including out of state.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand there is a risk of technical failures during the telehealth encounter beyond the control of FNN. I agree to hold harmless FNN for delays in evaluation or for information lost due to such technical failures.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that I have the right to withhold or withdraw my consent to the use of telehealth in the course of my care at any time, without affecting my right to future care or treatment. I understand that I may suspend or terminate use of the telehealth services at any time for any reason or for no reason. I understand that if I am experiencing a medical emergency, that I will be directed to dial 9-1-1 immediately and that the FNN providers are not able to connect me directly to any local emergency services.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that alternatives to telehealth consultation, such as in-person services are available to me, and in choosing to participate in a telehealth consultation, I understand that some parts of the services involving tests may be conducted by individuals at my location, or at a testing facility, at the direction of the FNN provider (e.g., labs or bloodwork).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that I may expect the anticipated benefits from the use of telehealth in my care, but that no results can be guaranteed or assured.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that my healthcare information may be shared with other individuals for scheduling and billing purposes. Persons may be present during the consultation other than the FNN provider in order to operate the telehealth technologies. I further understand that I will be informed of their presence in the consultation and thus will have the right to request the following: (1) omit specific details of my medical history/examination that are personally sensitive to me; (2) ask non-medical personnel to leave the telehealth examination; and/or (3) terminate the consultation at any time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that I will not be prescribed any narcotics for pain, nor is there any guarantee that I will be given a prescription at all.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand that if I participate in a consultation, that I have the right to request a copy of my medical records which will be provided to me at reasonable cost of preparation, shipping and delivery.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Patient Consent</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have read this document carefully, and understand the risks and benefits of the telehealth consultation and have had my questions regarding the procedure explained and I hereby give my informed consent to participate in a telehealth consultation under the terms described herein.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
