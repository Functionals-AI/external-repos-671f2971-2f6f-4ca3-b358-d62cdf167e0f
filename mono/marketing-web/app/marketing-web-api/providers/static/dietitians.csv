","I don’t believe there is one ideal diet for humans. Humans have survived on a wide variety of different diets over millennia because we have adapted to thrive on what is locally and seasonally available. But, even among seemingly opposing nutrition philosophies, there is an overwhelming consensus that the highly processed foods of the last 100 years are a major contributor to the worsening health of our population. But we all would also agree that the convenience of these foods has allowed us to maintain a pace and standard of life that would not be possible if our only option was to cook (and grow) all our food from scratch.  For this reason, I do not see food as “good” or “bad”. It all serves a purpose, with its nutritional qualities laying somewhere on a spectrum.

With ten years of experience as a RDN, she worked in both clinical and outpatient settings providing medical nutrition therapy to those with acute and chronic conditions. Specifically, she provided dietary counseling and nutrition support to cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation treatment. In addition, she successfully created and led a cancer survivorship course on healthy eating to prevent active cancer recurrence and promote remission. The knowledge of evidence-based practice guided her work as a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN) and ultimately led to her interest in advanced studies. Therefore, she obtained her PhD (a doctorate) in Cell and Molecular Biology to understand how nutrition drives molecular changes within a cell to benefit human health.","I don’t believe that there is one ideal diet for anyone.
